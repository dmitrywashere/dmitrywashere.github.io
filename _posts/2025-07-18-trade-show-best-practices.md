# Trade Shows Aren’t a Punishment — They’re an Opportunity (If You Do Them Right)

<img src="/assets/images/trade-show-best-practices/trade-shows.jpg" alt="Trade Show" width="700">

After 10+ years attending, working, and surviving tech industry trade shows, I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the “why is this booth giving out live goldfish?” moments.

And if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this:

> **Trade shows are what you make of them.**

They’re not just an excuse to hand out swag, collect badges, and hope a lead magically appears. They’re an investment — in time, money, and brand. And too often, companies approach them like a chore instead of the opportunity they truly are.

So here’s my personal playbook for making these events *worth it*.

---

## ❌ Rule #1: Don’t Sit Behind the Table

This one’s non-negotiable.

That beautifully draped table? It’s a **barrier** — physical and psychological. If you're parked behind it with your arms crossed and a badge scanner in hand, you’re broadcasting:

> “Please don’t interrupt my day.”

Instead, get **out front**. Be on your feet. Move with intention. Smile. Engage. Be visible and approachable.  
You’re not guarding the booth — *you are the booth*.

## 😎 Be Human First, Technical Second

Trade shows aren’t just about technology — they’re about people.

Yes, know your stuff. But don’t lead with speeds, feeds, or slide decks. Lead with **curiosity**.

- Ask thoughtful questions  
- Share an authentic story  
- Smile like you actually want to be there  
- And listen — actually listen to hear — when someone shares a challenge

> You’re building trust, not just taking notes.

## 🧍 Don’t Just “Man the Booth” — Own the Mission

Some companies treat trade shows like a checkbox and send the most junior folks to “cover the booth.”

Here’s what happens:  
You get tchotchke hunters, conference wanderers, and folks asking where the lunch line is.

If you want real conversations — the kind that uncover needs, spark partnerships, and build pipeline — you need people who can think, listen, and connect the dots.

Don’t outsource that to a stack of branded koozies.

## 🎯 It’s Your Job to Extract Value

Let’s be real: these events aren’t cheap.  
So treat them as the **business opportunity** they are.

You’re not being punished. You’re not “just working the booth.” You’re there to:

- Start conversations  
- Uncover insights  
- Identify opportunities  
- Build relationships

That doesn’t happen if you’re scrolling on your phone or hiding behind a demo screen.  
It happens when you show up — mentally, physically, and conversationally.

## 🧠 Bonus Pro Tips

- Bring mints. No one wants to talk over your coffee breath.  
- Wear comfortable shoes. Trade shows = step count personal bests.  
- Never be too busy to say hello — you never know who’s walking by.  
- If someone says, “Just looking” — respect it. But stay open.  
- Sit with random people at lunch, introduce yourself and LISTEN.

## 💬 Final Thought

Trade shows aren’t just about visibility. They’re about **engagement**.  
And the best conversations don’t happen behind a table — they happen eye-to-eye, story-to-story.

So next time you step onto that expo floor, ask yourself:

> “Am I here to survive this event… or to make something happen?”

**Choose the latter.**

And bring the mints. Trust me on that one.
