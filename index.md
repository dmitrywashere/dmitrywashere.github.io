# 🚚 We’re Moving (Well… Mostly)

If you’re reading this, you’re probably looking for comments, reactions, or a way to join the conversation.

Plot twist:  
I lost a prolonged and humbling battle with browser security, iframes, and modern web “protections.”  
(Inter-frame security: 1, Dmitry: 0)

So this blog is **moving / has moved** to a new home where discussion is easier and participation is encouraged.

👉 **New home:** https://dmitrywashere.substack.com/

I’ll still keep this site around for reference, archives, and the occasional experiment, but **new posts and active discussion will live on Substack**.

If you’d like to:
- comment
- ask questions
- disagree respectfully
- or just follow along

**Subscribe there (it’s free).**

Same topics, same curiosity, same occasional overthinking:
- technology & architecture  
- value selling and pre-sales realities  
- Systems Engineer experiences  
- home-lab tinkering  

Thanks for reading, and thanks for following me to the new neighborhood.

— Dmitry
