The best technology is useless without trust.

While data, cloud, and AI move at a relentless pace, the biggest challenge in tech isn't implementation—it's human connection. As a Systems Engineering Manager at Pure Storage, I’ve realized that mastery isn't just knowing the tech; it's mastering the pre-sales process.

I’m Dmitry Gorbatov, and this blog is dedicated to untangling the complexities of technical sales strategy. Here, we move past the specs and dive deep into best practices, human-centered deal design, and the emotional intelligence required to lead and win.

Don't worry, we'll maintain our technical edge. You'll still find practical, deep-dive content on Pure Storage, hybrid cloud strategies, and infrastructure insights right alongside our discussions on high-EQ selling. Join me as we explore both the skills and the systems that drive breakthrough results.
